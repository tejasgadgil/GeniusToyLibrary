        <h4>Welcome to Genius Toy Library!!</h4>

        <p style="margin-top: 25px;">It is universally accepted that Toys/ Books are an integral part of Childâ€™s Learning and Development. As a concerned parent, we always want to provide them with the best learning aids and toys. But the interest they show for a particular toy is for a limited time span. Also during these foundation years they need exposure to new things all the time which can be achieved by exploring through variety of toys and learning aids. So eventually parents end up buying many toys and stacking them up at home. Still the next time we go to buy toys, we wonder how long he/she going to use it? Where will I keep it? Is it worth full purchase?</p>
        
        <p style="margin-top: 25px;">
            This is where 'A Toy Library' concept proves as a boon for Parents.
